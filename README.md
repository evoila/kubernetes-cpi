# Bosh CPI for Kubernetes
This repository contains a Bosh CPI for Kubernetes. It shall enable people to deploy Bosh deployments on Kubernetes for Dev and Test.

## Important 
The Bosh CPI for Kubernetes is not there to provide a connector for production runtime on Kubernetes. 

Currently Bosh has some limitations in its design, which prevent a redeployment of failing Pods.

# Installation

## Requirements
You have setup your Go environment with:
* Go Binaries 
* Go Path
* Godep installed `go get github.com/tools/godep`
* Glide installed 

## Getting started
After setting up the core environment the next step is to load the Kubernetes Go Client. This is a bit more of work, as we need to retrieve the specific version:

```shell
glide update
```

## Release
To use this, it needs to be integrated into a Bosh release.
